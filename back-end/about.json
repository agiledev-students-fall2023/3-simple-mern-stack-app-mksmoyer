    "bio": "Hi! My name is Michael Smoyer, I'm from Portland, Oregon, and I am a computer science student at NYU. I am excited to learn how to work with other developers and how to program web applications. I feel underprepared for this class, but I know I am going to learn a lot and am grateful for the opportunity.\n\nI was led to computer science by my interest in math, and since starting the major I have found working with computers to be extremely satisfying. My other interests include music, golf, and basketball. I love New York City, especially how walkable it is, and have loved living in the area surrounding NYU for the last three years. I plan to live in the city with my lovely girlfriend for the foreseeable future and pursue a career in the tech industry. Thanks for visiting my page!",
